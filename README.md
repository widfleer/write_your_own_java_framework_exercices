# Write your own java framework
Understand how Spring, JakartaEE, Jackson, Guice and Hibernate works by rewriting a toy version of them.

[Tips and Tricks used in the implementations](COMPANION.md)

- [Writing objects to JSON](mapper/README.md) &#9734; and [Reading objects from JSON](mapper/README2.md) &#9734;&#9734;&#9734;
- [Dependency Injection](injector/README.md) &#9734; and [Annotation classpath scanning](injector/README2.md) &#9734;
- [Interceptor and Aspect Oriented Programming](interceptor/README.md) &#9734;&#9734;
- [Object Relational Mapping (ORM)](orm/README.md) &#9734;&#9734;&#9734;

The number of &#9734; indicates the implementation complexity (&#9734; is easier than &#9734;&#9734;&#9734;).
